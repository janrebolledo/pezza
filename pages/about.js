          <p>
            I&apos;m Perry and I currently study Film &amp; Television at Bond
            University after finding my passion in video editing. I started
            editing videos 6 years ago for my own YouTube channel before I
            discovered I could do it for clients as my job. So, I started my
            business in January 2022 and since then, I&apos;ve been fully
            focused on improving my skillset. The videos I&apos;ve edited for
            YouTube have accumulated a combined view count of over 20 million
            with 12.5 million (spread across 510 videos) of those views coming
            from 2021 alone. More recently, I&apos;ve had the opportunity to
            work on movie trailers, TV shows, corporate videos, and sporting
            highlight videos.
